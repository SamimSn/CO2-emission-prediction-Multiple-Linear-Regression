# CO2 Emission Model

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for modeling CO2 emissions. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning model implementation to predict CO2 emissions based on various features.

## Files

- `co2_emission_model.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow from data loading to model evaluation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.11
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

4. Open `co2_emission_model.ipynb` in your Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab interface.

## Notebook Overview

1. **Data Loading**: The notebook begins with loading the dataset required for modeling CO2 emissions.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Includes steps like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and analysis to understand the relationships and patterns in the data.
4. **Model Building**: Implementation of various machine learning models to predict CO2 emissions.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
6. **Conclusion**: Summary of findings and potential next steps.

## Usage

- Follow the steps in the notebook to reproduce the results.
- Modify the notebook to experiment with different models or data preprocessing techniques.
